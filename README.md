# ‚ôª Singapore Plastic Waste Disposed Machine Learning

This is a machine learning app using supervised learning (Multiple Linear Regression model).

Problem Statement: How might we predict the annual volume of plastic waste disposed in Singapore based on population size and GDP per capita to aid the Singapore Government's decision-making to promote sustainable growth and effective waste management?

## üéØ Motivation
In Singapore, the waste generated yearly is distributed across two major pathways: recycling and disposal. Those sent for recycling are sorted through and processed to recover any materials that could be used again in manufacturing new products. The remaining waste is sent for disposal via incineration. Any incineration ash along with non-combustibles are then sent to the offshore Semakau Landfill. Among the various material types, the disposal of plastics is particularly worrying. Plastic waste is the biggest contributor to the total annual volume of waste disposed. Its low recycling rate means that majority of plastic waste produced in Singapore is incinerated. Semakau Landfill is projected to hit full capacity by 2035 and the high incineration rate of plastic waste only speeds up this timeline. As Singapore's sole landfill, once it is full, there will be no other immediate alternative for disposal of waste. Construction and maintenance of a new landfill will cost a copious amount of time and money. Additionally, the low recycling rate of plastic waste also results in the loss of valuable energy and raw materials that were used in manufacturing. Hence, it is crucial that the Singapore Government can accurately forecast the annual volume of plastic waste disposed. This can aid the planning for future waste management and material recovery infrastructure and allocation of land for any landfill space needed. Policymakers can also create more targeted and timely regulations and laws that encourage sustainability in product manufacturing among companies or recycling behaviour among consumers.

## Potential Users (User Personas)

**User 1: Jane**
- Age: 26
- Occupation: Accountant
- Location: Toa Payoh
- Housing: Condominium
- About: She holds a 9-5 accounting job, working from home on a daily basis. She enjoys the convenience of this job, being able to stay at home for the whole day and ordering in when she needs to consume her meals on the clock. To cope with stress from work, she indulges in online shopping, often buying large amounts of clothing or lifestyle products.
- Pain Points:
  - The eateries that she frequently gets take-away from uses a lot of plastic packaging. These plastic packaging can be troublesome to wash for recycling, resulting in her simply throwing all of them into the rubbish bin.
  - The recycling bins are located at the carpark downstairs, making it bothersome to bring down any rubbish she wishes to recycle. On the other hand, simply throwing them into the common refuse chute on her floor saves time and energy.
  - The packaging of e-commerce parcels vary in material and form across different stores, as well as often containing a mix of materials such as both plastic and paper. This makes sorting the rubbish based on material time-consuming hence she mostly bothers to recycle those single-material packaging, throwing away the rest.
