# â™» Singapore Plastic Waste Disposed Machine Learning

This is a machine learning app using a supervised learning  model (Multiple Linear Regression).

Problem Statement: How might we predict the annual volume of plastic waste disposed in Singapore based on population size and GDP per capita to aid the Singapore Government's decision-making to promote sustainable growth and effective waste management?

## Data Extraction

Three datasets have been considered for this machine learning project.

1. Waste Management and Overall Recycling Rates Annual

This dataset details the annual volume of waste generated, disposed and recycled in tonnes, with the waste generated being the sum of waste disposed and waste recycled.
From 1996 to 1999, the data was obtained from Envcares which includes a screenshot of the plastic waste statistics from the National Environment Agency (NEA) in Singapore. From 2000 to 2024, the data was obtained from the Singapore Department of Statistics, specifically the material "Plastic" under the category "Total Disposed".

2. Per Capita GDP In Chained 2015 Dollars Annual

This dataset details the annual GDP per capita and manufacturing GDP per capita in chained dollars as well as the year on year growth rates, from 1960 to 2024.
Aligning with the years found in the first dataset, the data in the column "Per Capita GDP in Chained (2015) Dollars" from 1996 to 2024 was selected.

3. Indicators On Population Annual

This dataset details the various characteristics of the country's population such as total population size and its breakdown by type of citizenship as well as population growth rate and density and gender ratio, from 1950 to 2024.
Aligning with the years found in the first dataset, the data in the column "Total Population" from 1996 to 2024 was selected.
