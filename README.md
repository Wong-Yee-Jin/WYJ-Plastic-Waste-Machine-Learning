# ‚ôª Singapore Plastic Waste Disposed Machine Learning

This is a machine learning app using supervised learning (Multiple Linear Regression model).

Problem Statement: How might we predict the annual volume of plastic waste disposed in Singapore based on population size and GDP per capita to aid the Singapore Government's decision-making to promote sustainable growth and effective waste management?

## üéØ Motivation
In Singapore, the waste generated yearly is distributed across two major pathways: recycling and disposal. Those sent for recycling are sorted through and processed to recover any materials that could be used again in manufacturing new products. The remaining waste is sent for disposal via incineration. Any incineration ash along with non-combustibles are then sent to the offshore Semakau Landfill.

Among the various material types, the disposal of plastics is particularly worrying. Plastic waste is the biggest contributor to the total annual volume of waste disposed. Its low recycling rate means that majority of plastic waste produced in Singapore is incinerated. Semakau Landfill is projected to hit full capacity by 2035 and the high incineration rate of plastic waste only speeds up this timeline. As Singapore's sole landfill, once it is full, there will be no other immediate alternative for disposal of waste. Construction and maintenance of a new landfill will cost a copious amount of time and money. Additionally, the low recycling rate of plastic waste also results in the loss of valuable energy and raw materials that were used in manufacturing. 

Hence, it is crucial that the Singapore Government can accurately forecast the annual volume of plastic waste disposed. This can aid the planning for future waste management and material recovery infrastructure and allocation of land for any landfill space needed. Policymakers can also create more targeted and timely regulations and laws that encourage sustainability in product manufacturing among companies or recycling behaviour among consumers.


## üòÅ Potential Users (User Personas)

**üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User 1: Jane**
- Age: 26
- Occupation: Accountant
- Location: Toa Payoh
- Housing: Condominium
- About: She holds a 9-5 accounting job, working from home on a daily basis. She enjoys the convenience of this job, being able to stay at home for the whole day and ordering in when she needs to consume her meals on the clock. To cope with stress from work, she indulges in online shopping, often buying large amounts of clothing or lifestyle products.
- Pain Points:
  - The eateries that she frequently gets take-away from uses a lot of plastic packaging. These plastic packaging can be troublesome to wash for recycling, resulting in her simply throwing all of them into the rubbish bin.
  - The recycling bins are located at the carpark downstairs, making it bothersome to bring down any rubbish she wishes to recycle. On the other hand, simply throwing them into the common refuse chute on her floor saves time and energy.
  - The packaging of e-commerce parcels vary in material and form across different stores, as well as often containing a mix of materials such as both plastic and paper. This makes sorting the rubbish based on material time-consuming hence she mostly bothers to recycle those single-material packaging, throwing away the rest.


**üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User 2: Pauline**
- Age: 41
- Occupation: Homemaker
- Location: Woodlands
- Housing: HDB
- About: She is married with two young children. She takes care of the household, maintaining its cleanliness. She goes grocery shopping at least 2 to 3 times a week, purchasing various household items such as cooking and cleaning supplies. To entertain her children, she also frequents toy stores, buying whatever interests her children.
- Pain Points
  - She finds having to bring along her own reusable bag to the supermarket an inconvenience. Given that she often buys a large amount of groceries each time, it is rather inconvenient to bring multiple reusable bags and she would just rather pay the plastic carrier fees.
  - As her children grows up and their preference in toys continually change, she clears the old toys once in awhile. She wishes to donate the old toys to a recycling center but such recycling  centers can be far from her house. Donation drives are also not particularly frequent so she just throws out the toys instead.


**üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User 3: Wayne**
- Age: 17
- Occupation: Student
- Location: Serangoon
- Housing: HDB
- About: He is a student studying at a school in Serangoon, near his house. He enjoys bubble tea, going to the nearby mall after school every day to buy it before going home. He plays basketball every day as well, in school and at the court below his house.  Whenever he plays basketball, he always buys multiple bottles of isotonic drinks to quench his thirst from the strenuous physical activity.
- Pain Points
  - After he finishes his bubble tea, he wishes to recycle the plastic cup and straw but it is difficult to find a place to rinse the cup before throwing them into the recycling bin. He has to walk all the way home before he can rinse it and throw it into the recycling bin.
  - Whenever he is with his friends and they go to purchase bottled drinks, he always reminds them to recycle the bottle. However, many of his friends do not understand the importance of cleaning the bottle out before recycling and simply throws the contaminated bottles into the recycling bin.


**üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User 4: Boon Heng**
- Age: 73
- Occupation: Retiree
- Location: Ang Mo Kio
- Housing: HDB
- About: Boon Heng is a retiree living in Ang Mo Kio. He can only read and speak Mandarin and Hokkien. His daily activities include going to the wet market to get fresh groceries and hanging out with his old friends at the community center. He has mild mobility issues, avoiding heavy lifting and long walks.
- Pain Points
  - He has difficulty understanding the recycling instructions and is often very uncertain about what items can or cannot be recycled, leading to a fear of ‚Äúdoing it wrong‚Äù.
  - The recycling bins are located at the open-air carpark downstairs. It is physically tiring for him to carry any recyclables he has to the bins.
  - Since the pandemic, he has become more reliant on food deliveries and hence consumes more single-use plastic. Despite wanting to recycle them, he is unsure how to do so and ends up just throwing them into the rubbish bin.
